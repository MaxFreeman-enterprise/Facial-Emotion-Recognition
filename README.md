# ☕ Facial-Emotion-Recognition - Neural Network project

## 🔎 Overview
This project trains a model made with DenseNet model structure to recognize the strongest emotion in a given face image
The model was train on Fer+ and Kdef data sets and has a success rate of 78% based on tests performed on a seperated dataset
